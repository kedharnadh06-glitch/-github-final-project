##  Project Description
This project is a basic calculator that helps determine the **Simple Interest (SI)** using the formula:

\[
SI = P \times T \times R
\]

Where:
- **P** = Principal amount  
- **T** = Time period in years  
- **R** = Annual rate of interest

## ⚙️ Input
- `p` → Principal amount  
- `t` → Time period in years  
- `r` → Annual rate of interest

- 

## 📤 Output
- `simple interest` → The calculated interest value based on the formula above.
